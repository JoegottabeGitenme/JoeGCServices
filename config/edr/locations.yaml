# EDR Named Locations Configuration
# 
# Global locations available for all EDR collections.
# Clients can query data at these locations using human-readable identifiers
# instead of raw coordinates via the /collections/{id}/locations endpoint.
#
# Location IDs should be unique, stable identifiers like:
# - ICAO airport codes (KJFK, EGLL, etc.)
# - WMO station IDs
# - City names or custom identifiers
#
# Coordinates are [longitude, latitude] in CRS:84 (WGS84).
