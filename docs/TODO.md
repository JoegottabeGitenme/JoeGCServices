- keep getting 'ingester is its own standalone service' and 'need to trigger the ingester after the downloader' or something maybe we need to create an 'ingester' crate now that we're doing all this zarr processing
- Need to come up with some more validation for OGC compliance, and look into whatever hot new MAP api specs there are
- Would like to get different output formats (geotiff, black/white png, etc)
- scope out creating an API for the grid processor so that we may use it for future EDR work
- Need a better landing page with some sample queries
- startup validation of the system should be another widget on the dashboard (did all of the requests made by the hammer produce an actual image?)
- getFeatureInfo should support arbitrary html output
- Need some swagger docs or something for WMS and WMTS
- we have a projection crate and also reprojecting logic in the grid processor crate 
- could we implement some sort of 'use this gradient' style magic? essentially just pass a b64 string of json or something to provide a colormap in a get request
- mayyybe we implement that magic AI/ML super duper compression thing igor showed off, would need to render each tile then just compress to that b64 string, ofc this would rely on the frontend being able to render it
