description: |
  Single-tile temporal test for GOES-19 satellite data.
  Isolates temporal caching from spatial variation.
  Perfect for debugging NetCDF cache behavior with satellite data.
  
  With only 5 time steps, this test cycles through them rapidly,
  providing clear insight into cache hit rates.

# Expected behavior:
# With 5 concurrent workers and 60s duration:
# - Each worker cycles through 5 times sequentially
# - Workers offset: W1 at T0, W2 at T1, W3 at T2, W4 at T3, W5 at T4
# - After first cycle (5 requests), all NetCDF files loaded
# - Subsequent cycles: 100% NetCDF cache hits (ideal scenario)
# - 5 unique rendered tiles total (one per time step)
#
# Cache metrics to observe:
# - First 5 requests: 0% NetCDF hit rate
# - Requests 6+: Should approach 100% hit rate
# - Memory: 5 files × 2.8 MB = ~14 MB baseline
# - Rendered tiles: 5 tiles × ~few KB each
#
# Perfect test for:
# - Verifying NetCDF cache works
# - Debugging temporal lookup logic
# - Measuring pure temporal cache overhead
# - Comparing GOES vs MRMS cache efficiency
