  Random temporal access pattern for GOES-19 satellite data.
  Tests worst-case cache behavior with unpredictable time access.
  
  With only 5 time steps, random access should still achieve
  good cache hit rates since all files fit comfortably in cache.

# Expected behavior:
# With 10 concurrent workers and 90s duration:
# - Random time selection per request
# - Unpredictable NetCDF file access pattern
# - Tests LRU cache with temporal randomness
#
# Cache analysis:
# - All 5 files easily fit in cache (14 MB total)
# - Should achieve high hit rate even with random access
# - Useful for testing cache eviction doesn't thrash
# - Spatial randomness adds rendered tile cache pressure
#
# Comparison to sequential:
# - Sequential: Predictable, optimal cache usage
# - Random: Unpredictable, tests cache robustness
# - With only 5 files, both should perform well
#
# Real-world use case:
# - Users comparing specific times (not animating)
# - Multiple users requesting different times simultaneously
# - Jump-to-time navigation in weather apps
