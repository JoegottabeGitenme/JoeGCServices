  Temporal test for GOES-18 (West) satellite imagery across 5 time steps.
  Tests cache behavior with satellite data (larger files than MRMS).
  5-minute intervals, Clean IR Band 13 (2 km resolution, 24/7 availability).
  
  GOES characteristics:
  - Update frequency: ~5 minutes (vs MRMS ~2 minutes)
  - File size: ~2.8 MB (vs MRMS ~400 KB)
  - Resolution: 2 km (vs MRMS ~1 km)
  - Coverage: CONUS from geostationary orbit

# Expected behavior with 15 concurrent workers and 120s duration:
# - Each worker cycles through 5 times sequentially
# - With 120s, each worker makes ~50-100 requests (depends on latency)
# - Times cycle: worker 1 starts at T0, worker 2 at T1, etc.
#
# Cache analysis:
# - First pass: 5 NetCDF cache misses (loading all time steps)
# - Subsequent passes: High NetCDF cache hit rate
# - File size: 5 files × 2.8 MB = ~14 MB in cache
# - Comparison to MRMS: Larger files but fewer time steps
# - Spatial variation (zoom 3-8): Tests rendered tile cache diversity
#
# GOES-specific considerations:
# - Geostationary projection (different from MRMS lat-lon)
# - Lower resolution (2 km) means fewer tiles at high zoom
# - Larger file size may stress cache more than MRMS
