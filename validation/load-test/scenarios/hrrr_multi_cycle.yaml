  HRRR multi-cycle temporal test - comparing multiple model runs.
  Tests temporal caching across different reference times (model cycles).
  
  Scenario: User compares how different model runs forecasted the same time,
  or reviews model consistency across cycles.
  
  Uses 3 model cycles (09Z, 10Z, 11Z) with their analysis times (+0h).
  This tests cache behavior with multiple reference times.

    - "2025-11-28T11:00:00Z"  # 11Z analysis

# Expected behavior:
# - 3 different model cycles (reference times)
# - Each cycle = different GRIB file (~130 MB each)
# - Cache pressure: 3 files × 130 MB = ~390 MB
# - Workers cycle through 09Z → 10Z → 11Z → 09Z → ...
#
# Cache analysis:
# - Tests reference time lookup in cache
# - Different from forecast hour cycling
# - Each model run has independent data
#
# Real-world use case:
# - Model comparison: "Did the 10Z run predict this better than 09Z?"
# - Model verification: Checking consistency across runs
# - Nowcast updates: Latest vs previous analysis
