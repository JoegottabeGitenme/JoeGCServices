description: |
  Single-tile temporal test - ideal for debugging and analyzing cache behavior.
  Requests the same tile at all 59 time steps repeatedly.
  This isolates temporal caching from spatial variation.
  
  Use case: Perfect for analyzing GRIB cache effectiveness.
  - First loop: 59 cache misses (one per time step)
  - Second+ loops: Should be 100% GRIB cache hits
  - Rendered tile cache: Should be 100% hits after first render of each time

# Expected behavior:
# With 5 concurrent workers and 60s duration:
# - Each worker cycles through 59 times sequentially
# - Workers are offset (worker 1 starts at T0, worker 2 at T1, etc.)
# - After warmup, all 59 GRIB files should be loaded
# - Subsequent requests should hit GRIB cache (99%+ hit rate)
# - Rendered tile cache: 59 unique tiles (one per time)
# - Perfect test for cache debugging and optimization
