description: |
  Comprehensive HRRR temporal test - all available times.
  Tests caching with full temporal coverage: multiple cycles × multiple forecasts.
  
  Uses all 9 available time combinations:
  - 3 model cycles (09Z, 10Z, 11Z)
  - 3 forecast hours per cycle (+0h, +1h, +2h)
  - 9 total GRIB files (~1.2 GB cache pressure)
  
  Most realistic test for HRRR temporal workload.

  times:
    # 09Z cycle
    - "2025-11-28T09:00:00Z"  # 09Z +0h
    - "2025-11-28T10:00:00Z"  # 09Z +1h (also 10Z +0h)
    - "2025-11-28T11:00:00Z"  # 09Z +2h (also 10Z +1h, 11Z +0h)
    # 10Z cycle (unique times)
    - "2025-11-28T12:00:00Z"  # 10Z +2h (also 11Z +1h)
    # 11Z cycle (unique time)
    - "2025-11-28T13:00:00Z"  # 11Z +2h

# Note: Some valid times are duplicated (available from multiple cycles)
# For example, 11:00Z exists in:
#   - 09Z cycle as +2h forecast
#   - 10Z cycle as +1h forecast  
#   - 11Z cycle as +0h analysis
#
# This tests WMS logic for selecting which file to use when
# multiple model runs cover the same valid time.

# Expected behavior:
# - Up to 9 unique GRIB files loaded
# - Cache pressure: 9 files × ~135 MB = ~1.2 GB
# - High cache hit rate after warmup
# - Tests both reference time and forecast hour lookups
#
# Cache considerations:
# - Largest cache footprint of all test scenarios
# - May exceed default cache sizes
# - Tests cache eviction under pressure
# - Important for tuning HRRR cache limits
#
# Real-world use case:
# - Complete forecast suite display
# - Multi-panel forecaster workstation
# - Comprehensive model verification
# - Archive browsing and comparison
